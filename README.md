# Crime-classification_using_Pyspark


**Project Title:** San Francisco Crime Classification using PySpark

**Project Description:**
In the era of data-driven decision-making, law enforcement agencies increasingly rely on data analysis to combat crime effectively. The San Francisco Crime Classification project leverages the power of PySpark, a Python library for working with packet capture files, to analyze network traffic data and classify cybercrimes in the San Francisco area.

**Objective:**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate system that can automatically classify different types of cybercrimes based on a given description. By doing so, law enforcement agencies can respond promptly to cyber threats and take appropriate actions to mitigate criminal activities.

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Collection:** The project starts with the collection of network packet capture data from various sources in the San Francisco area. This data will include information about network traffic, such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, and packet payloads.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** PyShark will preprocess the raw packet capture data. This involves extracting relevant features and cleaning the data for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering is critical in building a classification model. Relevant features from the packet data will be selected and transformed to create a feature set suitable for machine learning.

4. **Machine Learning Model:** A machine learning model, such as a deep neural network or a random forest classifier, will be trained using the preprocessed data. The model will learn to classify network traffic into different categories of cybercrimes, such as DDoS attacks, malware infections, or phishing attempts.

5. **Evaluation and Validation:** The performance of the classification model will be evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques will be employed to ensure the model's robustness.
